# Hello, I'm Aditya üëã

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm currently a 2nd-year Computer Science Engineering student pursuing my B.Tech degree from KIT's College of Engineering, Kolhapur.

## üòÑ About Me 

As a passionate and driven developer, my ultimate goal is to become a low-level systems programmer with a strong expertise in networking and cloud-native architecture. I aim to design hyper-efficient, environmentally friendly systems that will revolutionize computing.

## üó∫Ô∏èMy Journey

Over the past two years, I've immersed myself in the world of coding, exploring various domains such as web development, mobile development, machine learning, web3, and game development. While I discovered a natural talent for web development and created numerous projects, I eventually found myself seeking new challenges. This led me to the fascinating world of cloud-native technologies.

The cloud-native ecosystem, with its vast array of components from monitoring to Kubernetes, containers, and service meshes, captivated me. I realized my passion for open source and the intricate, interesting projects within the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).
